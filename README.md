## General Info
The AngerDiary project is a desktop application built using C# that allows users to track and manage their feelings of anger and related behaviors. The application runs in the console and provides users with a simple and intuitive interface for recording and tracking their anger triggers, reactions, and coping strategies.

The project is structured using object-oriented programming principles and includes several classes and methods that handle user input, data storage and retrieval, and output to the console.

Users can create a new entry in the diary to record their anger triggers and reactions, and they can also view their past entries to identify patterns and trends in their anger patterns over time. The application allows users to add notes about coping strategies that work for them, which can be helpful in managing their anger in the future.

The project also includes a suite of unit tests to ensure that the code is working as expected.

This project is intended as a sample application for learning purposes, and it can be used as a starting point for building more complex desktop applications. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
